// This object is used for basic static NPCs with talk sprites.
// All children of this object should have their talk animation set as their sprite, with the first frame being
// the standing / not talking one.

// THIS OBJECT DOES NOT HANDLE INTERACTION. NPCs do not handle that themselves. Use obj_interaction for all
// interaction, including NPCs.
